  - name: Screwdriver
    tags: [tool]
    info:
      notes: One of the most, if not the most essential tool. Used in moving windows and grilles, building Computers, opening maintenance panels in electronics, fixing microwaves, modifying small devices, opening cyborg heads and more.

  - name: Wirecutters
    tags: [tool]
    info:
      notes: Used in wiring, hacking, deconstructing computers, etc. Live wires should always be handled with insulated gloves.

  - name: Multitool
    tags: [tool]
    info:
      notes: An electrician's precision tool. Known mostly for being a cornerstone of hacking, it's also essential for repairing destroyed APC units. The hard plastic casing makes it handy for pistol-whipping someone in a pinch.

  - name: Wrench
    tags: [tool]
    info:
      notes: Used in building computers, activating cyborgs, deconstructing walls and furniture.

  - name: Wirecutters

  - name: Crowbar
    tags: [tool]
    info:
      notes: A general-purpose opener. First used by assistants to pry open firelocks and unpowered doors on the way to the escape shuttles, they are also essential for prying open or wedging shut floor tiles, window frames, wall girders, computer modules, pod casings and so on.

  - name: Body Armor
    tags: [clotes, armor]
    info:
      notes: Provides moderate protection to the torso. Will help you survive psychotic murderers wielding revolvers and laser guns slightly longer.

  - name: Welder
    tags: [tool]
    info:
      notes: A heavy engineering tool. An active welder will ignite plasma, break lightbulbs, set off fire alarms just being held in a hand near the vicinity of a sensor and do horrible things when swung at a person. Must be activated to work and the fuel tank is small, so be sure to top up often. Has nearly as many uses as screwdrivers and crowbars, but operating one will cause eye damage without proper eyewear. Can dismantle walls, fix robots, melt shards into glass, seal doors, clear the space kudzu, fight the meat kudzu, etc.

  - name: Security Helmet
    tags: [clotes, armor]
    info:
      notes: Provides moderate protection to the head. You can still be rendered unconscious from repeated trauma, but the helmet helps avoid the dreaded one-hit stun attack.

  - name: Cable coil
    ingredients:
      - Wire
    info:
      notes: A bunch of wire

  - name: Wire
    info:
      notes: Spare cable, found plentifully in yellow toolkits and boxes marked "Cable Storage". Used in constructing computers, repairing damaged wiring under floors, fixing APCs, building pods, fixing cyborgs, making pretty art, and making a crap-ton of other neat stuff! Check out Guide to Wiring for details on how to put floors and wire together to make things happen.

  - name: Power Cell
    tags: []
    info:
      notes: Main power for Robots, backup juice for APCs before the lights go out. They're just high-capacity batteries. If depleted they may be recharged at either the Recharger in Engineering Storage or in an engine-powered APC. Every APC in the station starts with a fully charged power cell. The power monitoring computers reporting any less than 100% charge on these is usually a sign that things are quickly going to hell. 

  - name: Light Tube
    tags: []
    info:
      notes: In addition to windows and floor tiles, the incandescent tubes are usually the first casualties of rampant chemistry in the science wing or the cafeteria. Boxes of replacement lights are available in Tool Storage, EVA, Electronics, and the Janitor's closet. They can also be fabricated in a rainbow of colors, including blacklight.

  - name: Metal Sheet
    tags: []
    info:
      notes: Used for many constructions. Available in Tool Storage, the Warehouse and EVA, but the Cargo Bay can handle enormous bulk orders. Can only be assembled in stacks of up to 50 by hand. 

  - name: Glass Sheet
    tags: []
    info:
      notes: Used for many constructions. Available in Tool Storage, the Warehouse and EVA, but the Cargo Bay can handle enormous bulk orders. Can only be assembled in stacks of up to 50 by hand.

  - name: Rods
    tags: []
    info:
      notes: Used for many constructions. Available in Tool Storage, the Warehouse, and EVA.

  - name: Floor Tile
    ingredients:
      - Metal Sheet
    tags: [make, floor]
    info:
      notes: Make these in fours from sheet metal, find them in the Warehouse, scavenge the many unfinished construction sites on the station or just crowbar them right out from under people's feet. Damaged floor tiles are automatically discarded upon removal.

  - name: Beaker
    tags: [container]
    info:
      notes: Holds up to 50 units of chemicals. Standard equipment for chemistry, but medbay has some as well.

  - name: Staple gun
    tags: [weapon, tool]
    info:
      notes: Reattach limbs! Put the patient on an operating table, attach their arm to the stump by aiming at it and secure it with the staple gun, causing a minor amount of brute damage. More can be made in a robotics fabricator, just like scalpels and saws.

  - name: Flashlight
    tags: [light]
    info:
      notes: Illuminates dark areas. Found in Emergency Toolboxes and the Warehouse, among other places. Small enough to fit in a pocket or on your belt, but can only be turned on/off remotely (HUD icon) when worn. Having multiple light sources on your person will "stack" with one another, lighting a larger area. Don't try to think too hard about how that works.

  - name: Gas Tank
    tags: [tank]
    info:
      notes: These large tanks hold up to 1013 kPa of gaseous elements. By default, they contain O2 (blue), an air mixture (blue w/ white stripe), N2O (white w/ red stripe) or Plasma (special sprite). With the exception of the latter, they can be worn on the back slot. Compatible with the connection port of Air Pumps, Air Scrubbers, Tank Transfer Valves and gas canisters.

  - name: Fuel Tank
    tags: [container]
    info:
      notes: This small tank has been designed specifically for holding flammable compounds. As such, they contain welding fuel by default. Essential component of flamethrowers.

  - name: Flash
    tags: [weapon]
    info:
      notes: The flash has two uses. Using the flash on someone without adequate eye protection will stun them and obscure their screen with a white flash. Every time the flash is used in this manner it has a chance of the bulb burning out, rendering it permanently useless. The other use of a flash is to use it in your active hand. This will briefly obscure the screens of everyone nearby with a white flash but not stun them. This effect can also disable any nearby cloaking device. Flashes can be found in security lockers, dispensed from the Security Vendor, in other various spots on the station, and in great supply at Robotics.

  - name: Remote Signaler
    tags: [tool]
    info:
      notes: Sends out a radio signal of a given value on a set frequency, and when attached to something, will activate when it receives that signal. It in turn can be attached a few other other items, which will cause it to send out a signal when that other item activates.

  - name: Proximity Sensor
    tags: [tool]
    info:
      notes: When armed, it will activate whenever it detects motion adjacent to it and emits a beep.

  - name: Timer

    info:
      notes: Activates once the timer hits 0.

  - name: Igniter
    tags: [tool]
    info:
      notes: Heats up the square it is on when activated. Can also be used to light cigarettes, but you'll never look as cool as when you're using a real lighter.

  - name: ElectroPack
    tags: []
    info:
      notes: Goes on to the back slot of a monkey or other victim-- cannot be removed by the wearer. The pack needs to be turned on first. It waits for a radio signal, and when received, delivers a debilitating jolt of electricity to whomever is wearing it.

  - name: Biosuit
    tags: [equip]
    info:
      notes: Offer some protection against diseases and viral hazards. Found in the Research Director's office, Custodial closet, and the research sector entrance vestibule.

  - name: Bedsheet 
    tags: [equip]
    info:

      notes: Protect from electrical shocks. Highly coveted for their ability to allow door hacking. Found in Engineering and Electronics and can be ordered by the Quartermaster.

  - name: Mousetrap
    tags: []
    info:
      notes: Regularly used by jerks to kill the Chef's only friend. You can also hide these in containers such as backpacks or emergency boxes to make traps for unsuspecting victims!
