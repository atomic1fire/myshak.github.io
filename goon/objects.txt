  - name: Welder
    tags: [tool]
    info:
      notes: A heavy engineering tool. An active welder will ignite plasma, break lightbulbs, set off fire alarms just being held in a hand near the vicinity of a sensor and do horrible things when swung at a person. Must be activated to work and the fuel tank is small, so be sure to top up often. Has nearly as many uses as screwdrivers and crowbars, but operating one will cause eye damage without proper eyewear. Can dismantle walls, fix robots, melt shards into glass, seal doors, clear the space kudzu, fight the meat kudzu, etc.

  - name: Power Cell
    tags: []
    info:
      notes: Main power for Robots, backup juice for APCs before the lights go out. They're just high-capacity batteries. If depleted they may be recharged at either the Recharger in Engineering Storage or in an engine-powered APC. Every APC in the station starts with a fully charged power cell. The power monitoring computers reporting any less than 100% charge on these is usually a sign that things are quickly going to hell.

Every time the flash is used, the bulb has a chance of burning out, rendering it permanently useless. They can be found in security lockers, dispensed from the vending machines and are in great supply in robotics.
