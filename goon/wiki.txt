    info:
      notes: |
             Forms a layer of slippery ice when dumped on the floor and freezes anybody in a large block of ice, preventing any actions short of speaking or breaking out. While frozen, you are immune to most outside dangers, though you will still take damage from poisons and especially being on fire. As a panic option, the quick freeze is also handy for immediately activating cryoxadone.
      application_effect: TOUCH - freezes the victim in a large block of ice. Break ice cubes by clicking the ice cube with the Harm intent repeatedly, even while frozen yourself.

      per_cycle: Increases the depletion rate of all other chems by 0.5, heals 1.5 TOX damage.

  - name: Saline-Glucose Solution
    ingredients:
      - Salt
      - Water
      - Sugar
    tags: [medical, brute, burn, heal]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: 33% chance per cycle of healing 1 point each of BRUTE and BURN damage.
      notes: The Shock ailment checks to see if you have any saline in you. If you do, there is a fixed chance per cycle that it'll reduce or remove the disease. This means that there's no specific amount needed to cure, but the longer it's in you, the more chances it'll have to cure the ailment.  
      
  - name: Styptic Powder
    ingredients: 
      - Aluminium 
      - Hydrogen 
      - Oxygen

      application_effect: |
                          -TOUCH: Heal 1 point of brute per unit applied. Splash, dropper.
                          -INGEST: Do 0.5 points of tox damage per unit ingested. Don't eat it, don't inject it.
      notes: It depletes rapidly in the blood, so most of your healing will come upfront from a topical application. 

  - name: Silver Sulfadiazine
    ingredients: 
      - Silver
      - Sulfur
      - Oxygen
      - Chlorine

      - Extracted from white cannabis leaves.
      - Pro Puffs
      - Donk Pockets
    tags: [medical, brute, burn, oxy, tox, heal, addictive]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.3
      overdose_threshold: 100
      per_cycle: 65% chance to heal one each of OXY, TOX, BRUTE and BURN.
      notes: Slightly addictive. Medbay will love the botanists if they manage to provide it. Might buff the healing rates and lower the depletion soon. 

  - name: Calomel
    ingredients: 
      - Mercury 
      - Chlorine
      - !step Heat to 380 K

    info:
      depletion_rate: 2
      per_cycle: Increases all depletion rates by 5. +5 TOX damage while health > 20.
      notes: Aggressive purgative. It'll do a lot of tox damage itself but it cannot kill you, as the tox damage only applies while you are above 20 health. Use for emergencies to handle the really aggressive poisons that would definitely kill you if they remain active for long.
      
  - name: Potassium Iodide
    ingredients: 
      - Potassium
      - Iodine
    sources:

    ingredients: 
      - Welding Fuel 
      - Chlorine
      - Ammonia

  - name: Cryoxadone
    ingredients: 
      - Cryostylane
      - Plasma 
      - Acetone 
      - Unstable Mutagen
    tags: [medical, oxy, tox, brute, burn, heal]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: IF BODY TEMP IS BELOW 240, heals 10 OXY, 3 TOX, 3 BRUTE, 3 BURN
      notes: Requires cooling the person before it kicks in, but heals incredibly well. 
      
  - name: Epinephrine
    ingredients: 
      - Phenol
      - Hydrogen 
      - Oxygen
      - Chlorine
      - Acetone
      - Diethylamine
    tags: [medical, stun, oxy, losebreath, tox, brute, burn, heal, heart, overdose, ko, stun, crit]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.2
      overdose_threshold: 20
      per_cycle: Reduces most of the knockout/stun effects. Attempts to cap OXY damage at 35 and LOSEBREATH at 3. If health is between -10 to -65, heals 1 TOX, 1 BRUTE, 1 BURN. Rolls a chance to fix heart problems.
      notes: Can make you pretty sick in overdoses. Rapidly counters histamine / allergy reactions. Very useful for stabilizing someone who is in mid-crit damage, standard emergency shot to buy yourself some time. If things are really bad, go for atropine instead. Ephedrine is similar to epinephrine but is a bit weaker. 
      
  - name: Atropine
    ingredients: 
      - Ethanol
      - Acetone 
      - Diethylamine
      - Phenol
      - Sulphuric Acid
    sources:
      - Extracted from black venne fibers.
    tags: [medical, tox, damage, brute, burn, heal, heart, oxy, losebreath, depletion, crit]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.2
      overdose_threshold: 25
      per_cycle: | 
                 1 TOX damage if used over -60 health. Causes dizziness and confusion.
                 If under -25 health, heals 3 BRUTE + 3 BURN. Rolls a chance to fix heart problems. Attempts to cap OXY damage at 65 and LOSEBREATH at 5. Increases sarin depletion by 10.
      notes: Fairly similar to epinephrine but will rapidly push deep-crit damage levels towards shallow crit levels. Use this if you find someone who is right at the edge of death. Flushes sarin extremely rapidly. Atropine alone won't outright kill people but it's a pretty decent debilitating poison if you wanna use it that way. 
      
  - name: Salicylic Acid
    ingredients: 
      - Sodium 
      - Phenol 
      - Carbon 
      - Oxygen 
      - Sulphuric Acid
    sources:
      - Extracted from unmutated contusine leaves.
    tags: [medical, brute, overdose, temperature, speed]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.1
      overdose_threshold: 25
      per_cycle: |
                 If BRUTE damage is under 50, 50% chance to heal one unit.
                 Tries to return high body temps towards normal. Fairly well counters walkspeed loss from being hurt.
      notes: Got beat up a bit and don't want to crawl the whole way to medbay? Pop one of these. Won't help severe damage. Slow depletion rate will keep it in your blood for awhile. 
      
  - name: Morphine
    soruces: 
      - Botany and QM can both provide it.
    tags: [medical, speed, addictive, overdose, ko, jitter]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      overdose_threshold: 20
      per_cycle: Dramatically counters movement reduction from severe injury. Reduces jitteriness if someone is shaking like crazy from whatever. Will knock you out within 36 cycles if any remains in you.
      notes: Used to be Sleep Toxin. Low doses are useful for the painkiller, otherwise it's mostly a grief chem.
      
  - name: Salbutamol
    ingredients: 
      - Salicylic Acid
      - Lithium
      - Aluminium
      - Bromine
      - Ammonia
    tags: [medical, oxy, losebreath, heal]
    sources:
      - Extracted from unmutated contusine leaves.
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: Heals 6 OXY damage, reduces LOSEBREATH by 4
      notes: Speeds up recovery from suffocation damage, but more importantly, it'll help counter suffocating/losebreath poisons and the suffocation that ramps up in critical health. Really underused emergency med, makes dealing with critical-health people a lot easier.
      
  - name: Perfluorodecalin
    ingredients: 
      - Hydrogen
      - Fluorine 
      - Oil 
      - !step Heat to 380 K
    heat_to: Heat to 380 K
    reaction_message: The mixture rapidly turns into a dense pink liquid.
    tags: [medical, oxy, losebreath, brute, burn, heal, addictive]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: Heals 25 OXY damage, causes LOSEBREATH - so you can't talk, but it prevents any suffocation damage from racking up despite that. 33% chance of healing 1 BRUTE and 1 BURN.
      notes: Fantastic for crime because it silences people. Also fantastic for pretty much negating all the accumulative damage from being in critical, will give you a really wide window of time to deal with other health problems. In theory you could stay in flatline for quite awhile with this stuff handling tissue oxygenation, but you might need Mannitol too. Can make spacewalking without internals possible. Somewhat addictive. 
      
  - name: Mannitol
    ingredients: 
      - Sugar
      - Hydrogen 
      - Water
    sources:

    tags: [medical, depletion, jitter, drowsiness]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: Causes a little bit of drowsiness, reduces jitteriness. Raises histamine and itching powder depletion rates by 3.
      notes: Mostly used as a precursor to a couple of the illegal drugs. Might be needed for bee stings, histamine poisonings, itching powder.

Overdose+ will cause increasingly worse and rapidly fatal effects simulating anaphylactic shock. Having 40+ units in your bloodstream can trigger +5 brute / +5 tox / +5 ox damage or more per cycle, so if you manage to hit someone with a large dose, it's very deadly.

The more you use, the longer it takes before anything happens, but the harder it hits when it does. With large doses your target can consume something poisoned, walk around for a few minutes minding their own business, and then abruptly die with no real warning. Very devious to use.

             A couple of common chem recipes can produce this if poorly mixed, and production of cyanide will dose nearby people if they aren''t wearing gas masks. Also a fairly easy poison.
             Balanced to be mostly a slow and scary killer, but if they get to medbay, it''s not that hard to deal with. Suffocation damage can rack up faster than tox depending on how the RNG rolls.

             Dump all the Discount Dan's flavours into a bathtub and heat it with a welder, you'll probably find it.
             Overdose will likely kill you from a half dozen different types of escalating damage. Even taking too many occasional doses can kill you from brain damage. Can give you Berserker. Makes you hallucinate all sorts of horrible shit and you''ll barely be able to control your movement as you go flying into everything around you fists-first. Decays into a bunch of other drugs and poisons. Bath salts boxing is hilarious.

      per_cycle: +3 BURNING. Sets people on fire from the inside out.
      application_effect: TOUCH - BURNING + 50.
      notes: |
             Comes into existence at 1000 degrees and makes a temporary 3x3 fireball when it does so, so be careful when mixing.
             ClF3 applied to a surface burns things that wouldn't otherwise burn, sometimes through the very floors of the station and exposing it to the vacuum of space. A very popular starting deathchem.
             Reacts violently with carbon tetrachloride (firefighting foam).

    tags: [ignite]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      penetrates_skin: No
      ignition_temp: 375 K
      notes: When mixed without stabilizer, or heated to 375 K with stabilizer, it'll make a large amount of smoke. Unlike foam, it can only carry three reagents from its container, in exchange for making the carried chems breathable through the air the smoke occupies, essentially giving them all "Penetrates Skin = Yes" functionality unless the victim has internals active.

      ignition_temp: 480 K
      notes: |
             Sparks, then blows the fuck up a second or two later. Damage scales up with reagent volume.
             Slow depletion means you can poison someone with it and then wait for then to encounter a heat source awhile later.

      notes: |
             Comes into existence at 0 degrees, but slowly heats all other reagents and objects on its tile up towards 1000 K, regardless of current surface or container.
             Can make non-flammable things scaldingly hot, but so can a welder or lighter. Fun for delayed self-heating reactions.

    info:
      notes: |
             Turns into foam when combined with water, carrying all other reagents in the container with it. Foam spreads fairly quickly and causes people to slip if they walk on it, making it very hard to escape whatever horrible things you put in it.
             WARNING: Most non-backbreaking methods of creating foam require you to do it by hand and thus be in the middle of the reaction, so make sure you can survive your own disaster.

             Reacts immediately upon mixing. After a short delay, the foam will turn into weak metal walls, which can be destroyed with a few whacks of a blunt object.
             A silly chem that can be as helpful or as harmful as you want it to be. You can either plug up holes in the station or inconvenience people with obstructions.
