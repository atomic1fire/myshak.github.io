  - name: Sugar
    tags: [base, stun, overdose, speed, ko, stamina, jitter]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      penetrates_skin: No
      per_cycle: |
                 50% chance of reducing an extra cycles worth of stun, paralysis and weaken
                 4% chance to produce a unit of epinephrine
      overdose_threshold: 200
      notes: Having a bit of sugar in you gives you a noticeable stun reduction, slight speed boost and minor stamina regeneration buff. Overdose effects can put someone into a coma. Corn syrup is more likely to accomplish this.
    sources:
      - Base chemical from the dispenser.
      - Base drink from the soda fountain.
      - Extracted from sugarcanes.
      
  - name: Radium
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.3
      penetrates_skin: Yes
      per_cycle: +4 RAD
      notes: Radiation is cumulative and depletes one per cycle. As it ramps up, it starts doing BURN + TOX in increasing amounts related to the radiation total, causes random mutations (often disabilities) and triggers a bunch of other nasty radiation sickness effects. A sleepypen full of radium is pretty lethal over a few minutes.
    sources:
      - Base chemical from the dispenser.
    tags: [base, rad, damage]

  - name: Helium
    sources:
      - Helium tanks.
    tags: [base]
    info:
     depletion_rate: 0.4
     penetrates_skin: No
     notes: Harmless. Does what you'd expect when inhaled (or injected).

# Medical chems
      
  - name: Charcoal
    ingredients:
      - Ash
      - Salt
      - !step Heat to 380 K
    heat_to: Heat to 380 K
    reaction_message: The mixture yields a fine black powder.
    sources:
      - Extracted from any venne fibers.
    tags: [medical, tox, heal, depletion]
    info:
      note: Good baseline thing for detoxifying someone, but won't always keep up with the hellpoisons.
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: Increases the depletion rate of all other chems by 0.5, heals 1.5 TOX damage.

  - name: Saline-Glucose Solution
    ingredients:
      - Salt
      - Water
      - Sugar
    tags: [medical, brute, burn, heal, crit]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: 33% chance per cycle of healing 1 point each of BRUTE and BURN damage.
      notes: The shock ailment checks to see if you have any saline in you. If you do, there is a fixed chance per cycle that it'll reduce or remove the disease. This means that there's no specific amount needed to cure, but the longer it's in you, the more chances it'll have to cure the ailment.  
      
  - name: Styptic Powder
    ingredients: 
      - Aluminium 
      - Hydrogen 
      - Oxygen 
      - Sulphuric Acid
    tags: [medical, brute, heal, tox, damage]
    reaction_message: The solution yields an astringent powder.
    info:
      per_cycle: 55% chance per cycle of healing 2 points of BRUTE damage.
      depletion_rate: 2
      application_effect: |
                          -TOUCH: Heal 1 point of brute per unit applied. Splash, dropper.
                          -INGEST: Do 0.5 points of tox damage per unit ingested. Don't eat it, don't inject it.
      notes: The go-to BRUTE damage medication, Healing patches are filled with it. It depletes rapidly in the blood, so most of your healing will come upfront from a topical application. Ingesting it doesn't work nearly as well and even causes a fair bit of TOX damage, so don't do that. 

  - name: Silver Sulfadiazine
    ingredients: 
      - Silver
      - Sulfur
      - Oxygen
      - Chlorine
      - Ammonia
      - Oil
    sources:
      - Extracted from all commol roots.
    depletion_rate: 2
    tags: [medical, burn, heal, tox, damage]
    info:
      per_cycle: 55% chance per cycle of healing 2 points of BURN damage.
      application_effect: |
                          -TOUCH: Heal 1 point of burn per unit applied.
                          -INGEST: Do 0.5 points of tox damage per unit ingested.
      notes: The BURN damage equivalent of styptic powder. Burn patches start with this. It depletes rapidly in the blood, so most of your healing will come upfront from a topical application. Ingesting it doesn't work nearly as well and even causes a fair bit of TOX damage, so don't do that.

  - name: Synthflesh
    ingredients: 
      - Blood
      - Carbon
      - Styptic Powder
    tags: [medical, brute, burn, heal]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: Does nothing in the bloodstream currently.
      application_effect: |
                          -TOUCH: Heals 1.5 BRUTE and 1.5 BURN per unit applied.
      notes: Splashing a beaker of synthflesh on someone is very, very effective.
      
  - name: Omnizine
    sources: 
      - Extracted from white cannabis leaves.
      - Extracted from glowing fruits.
      - Pro Puffs.
      - Warm donk pockets.
    tags: [medical, brute, burn, oxy, tox, heal, addictive, overdose]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.2
      overdose_threshold: 30
      per_cycle: 65% chance to heal one each of OXY, TOX, BRUTE and BURN.
      notes: Slightly addictive. Omnizine-laced Pro Puffs and warm donk pockets deliver a small dose of omnizine when eaten. Less ideal than botany, but it could save you in a pinch.

  - name: Calomel
    ingredients: 
      - Mercury 
      - Chlorine
      - !step Heat to 380 K
    heat_to: Heat to 380 K
    reaction_message: Stinging vapors rise from the solution.
    tags: [medical, depletion, tox, damage]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 2
      per_cycle: Increases all depletion rates by 5. +5 TOX damage while health > 20.
      notes: Aggressive purgative. It'll do a lot of tox damage itself but it cannot kill you, as the tox damage only applies while you are above 20 health. Use for emergencies to handle the really aggressive poisons that would definitely kill you if they remain active for long.
      
  - name: Potassium Iodide
    ingredients: 
      - Potassium
      - Iodine
    sources:
      - Extracted from all nureous leaves.
    tags: [medical, rad, heal]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: 80% chance of removing 1 RAD. Radiation is cumulative and causes tox+burn.
      notes: Simple and weak, but can help counter radiation events and radium somewhat. 
      
  - name: Pentetic Acid
    ingredients: 
      - Welding Fuel 
      - Chlorine
      - Ammonia 
      - Embalming Fluid 
      - Sodium 
      - Cyanide
    tags: [medical, rad, tox, depletion, heal, brute, damage]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: Reduces 7 RAD, heals 3 TOX damage, increases all depletion rates by 4; 33% chance of taking 1 unit brute damage
      notes: Apex antitox/antiradiation treatment. 
      
  - name: Cryoxadone
    ingredients: 
      - Cryostylane
      - Plasma 
      - Acetone 
      - Unstable Mutagen
    tags: [medical, oxy, tox, brute, burn, heal, temperature]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: IF BODY TEMP IS BELOW 240, heals 10 OXY, 3 TOX, 3 BRUTE, 3 BURN
      notes: Requires cooling the target before it kicks in, but heals incredibly well. The cryo tanks in medbay run off of this. Don't cool down someone who is currently on fire, put them out first. Due to the way BURN damage is handled, cooling a flaming person will make the fire worse and cause more damage than even the cryoxadone can keep up with.

  - name: Ephedrine
    ingredients: 
      - Sugar 
      - Oil 
      - Hydrogen 
      - Diethylamine
    reaction_message: The solution fizzes and gives off toxic fumes.
    sources:
      - Extracted from all asomna barks and omega cannabis leaves.
      - Grones soda.
    tags: [medical, stun, speed, heal, crit, stamina, addictive, overdose, heart]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.3
      penetrates_skin: No
      overdose_threshold: 35
      per_cycle: Stun reduction per cycle, increases run speed slightly, minor stamina regeneration buff, stabilizes crit.
      notes: It's pretty much just a weaker analogue of medbay's epinephrine, but it's addictive and has a few more side effects.
      
  - name: Epinephrine
    ingredients: 
      - Phenol
      - Hydrogen 
      - Oxygen
      - Chlorine
      - Acetone
      - Diethylamine
    tags: [medical, stun, oxy, losebreath, tox, brute, burn, heal, heart, overdose, stun, crit, stamina]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.2
      overdose_threshold: 20
      per_cycle: Reduces most of the knockout/stun effects, minor stamina regeneration buff. Attempts to cap OXY damage at 35 and LOSEBREATH at 3. If health is between -10 to -65, heals 1 TOX, 1 BRUTE, 1 BURN. Rolls a chance to fix heart problems.
      notes: Can make you pretty sick in overdoses. Rapidly counters histamine / allergy reactions. Very useful for stabilizing someone who is in mid-crit damage, standard emergency shot to buy yourself some time. If things are really bad, go for atropine instead. Ephedrine is similar to epinephrine but is a bit weaker. 
      
  - name: Atropine
    ingredients: 
      - Ethanol
      - Acetone 
      - Diethylamine
      - Phenol
      - Sulphuric Acid
    sources:
      - Extracted from black venne fibers and omega cannabis leaves.
    tags: [medical, tox, damage, brute, burn, heal, heart, oxy, losebreath, depletion, crit, movement, overdose]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.2
      overdose_threshold: 25
      per_cycle: | 
                 1 TOX damage if used over -60 health. Causes dizziness and confusion.
                 If under -25 health, heals 3 BRUTE + 3 BURN. Rolls a chance to fix heart problems. Attempts to cap OXY damage at 65 and LOSEBREATH at 5. Increases sarin depletion by 10.
      notes: Fairly similar to epinephrine but will rapidly push deep-crit damage levels towards shallow crit levels. Use this if you find someone who is right at the edge of death. Flushes sarin extremely rapidly. Atropine alone won't outright kill people but it's a pretty decent debilitating poison if you wanna use it that way. 
      
  - name: Salicylic Acid (Painkiller)
    ingredients: 
      - Sodium 
      - Phenol 
      - Carbon 
      - Oxygen 
      - Sulphuric Acid
    sources:
      - Extracted from all contusine leaves.
    tags: [medical, brute, overdose, temperature, speed]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.1
      overdose_threshold: 25
      per_cycle: |
                 If BRUTE damage is under 50, 50% chance to heal one unit.
                 Tries to return high body temps towards normal. Fairly well counters walkspeed loss from being hurt.
      notes: Got beat up a bit and don't want to crawl the whole way to medbay? Pop one of these. Won't help severe damage. Slow depletion rate will keep it in your blood for awhile. 
      
  - name: Morphine
    sources: 
      - Medical vendors and QM can provide it.
    tags: [medical, speed, addictive, overdose, ko, jitter, stamina]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      overdose_threshold: 20
      per_cycle: Dramatically counters movement reduction from severe injury, severe stamina regeneration penalty. Reduces jitteriness if someone is shaking like crazy from whatever. Will knock you out within 36 cycles if any remains in you.
      notes: Used to be sleep toxin. Low doses are useful for the painkiller, but high doses can knock someone out for a while. Addictive.

      depletion_rate: 0.2
      per_cycle: Heals 6 OXY damage, reduces LOSEBREATH by 4
      notes: Speeds up recovery from suffocation damage, but more importantly, it'll help counter suffocating/losebreath poisons and the suffocation that ramps up in critical health. Really underused emergency med, makes dealing with critical-health people a lot easier since OXY damage is usually what kills in-crit patients in the end.

      notes: Fantastic for criminal activity because it silences people. Also fantastic for pretty much negating all the accumulative damage from being in critical, will give you a really wide window of time to deal with other health problems. In theory you could stay in flatline for quite awhile with this stuff handling tissue oxygenation, but you might need Mannitol too. Can make spacewalking without internals possible. Somewhat addictive.

      notes: |
             Below the overdose threshold, it'll mess your vision up and make you cough and sneeze a lot and take occasional BRUTE damage. Overdose+ will cause increasingly worse and rapidly fatal effects simulating anaphylactic shock. Having 40+ units in your bloodstream can trigger +5 brute / +5 tox / +5 ox damage or more per cycle, so if you manage to hit someone with a large dose, it's very deadly.

The more you use, the longer it takes before anything happens, but the harder it hits when it does. With large doses your target can consume something poisoned, walk around for a few minutes minding their own business, and then abruptly die with no real warning. Very devious to use.

      notes: |
             A couple of common chem recipes can produce this if poorly mixed, and production of cyanide will dose nearby people if they aren't wearing gas masks. Also a fairly easy poison.
             Balanced to be mostly a slow and scary killer, but if they get to medbay, it's not that hard to deal with. Suffocation damage can rack up faster than tox depending on how the RNG rolls.

    info:

      ignition_temp: 375 K
      notes: |
             When mixed without stabilizer, or heated to 375 K with stabilizer, it'll spew out a large butt of smoke. It then takes up to three other chems (the ones with the most units present) from its container with it, inflicting their TOUCH reactions and making them breathable through the air (read: gives them "Penetrates Skin = Yes" functionality) for whatever is hit by the smoke. Very handy for delivering chemicals that otherwise need to be injected to work.
             Wearing active internals or a Gas Mask will prevent you from inhaling chemical smoke. Even if an acid is employed in the smoke to destroy the active internals or Gas Mask, the victim still won't suck anything from that specific smoke.

             Comes into existence at 0 degrees, but slowly heats all other reagents and objects on its tile up towards 1000 K, regardless of current surface or container.
             Can make non-flammable things scaldingly hot, but so can a welder or lighter. Fun for delayed self-heating reactions.
             
             Do NOT use pyrosium in foam or smoke. While you might like the idea of self-heating hellfoams, the multitude of heat interval checks from pyrosium foam/smoke lags the server to hell.

             When Sorium is mixed without stabilizer, or stabilized and then heated a fair bit, it explodes into a shockwave and blasts everything away that isn't bolted down. The shockwave is explosive in typing and thus does minor BRUTE damage, and anything that hits you when blown away will also do some BRUTE.

             Sucks everything into the detonation point.
             Pretty much the inverse of Sorium. Despite not doing any damage on its own however, it's far more dangerous, as getting sucked in and hit by a hundred different objects is easily enough to do crit levels of BRUTE damage. A very devious chem for dragging people kicking and screaming into your foams and smokes, if you feel like overkill.

             Overdose can cause random amounts of TOX damage, BRUTE damage, BRAIN damage, or give you a case of non-contagious Berserker. Very addictive, but the stun reduction effect is pretty nice for fighting.
             Note that everything other than the Welding Fuel needs to be heated to 390 K, as the Welding Fuel has a bad habit of igniting before the reaction happens in the reagent heater.

  - name: Foamed Metal
    unsorted: true
    ingredients:
      - Fluorosurfactant
      - Sulphuric acid
      - <Aluminium> OR <Iron>
    reaction_message: The metal begins to foam up! / The metal begins to foam up, becoming rigid and tough!
    info:
     notes: |
            Reacts immediately upon mixing. After a short delay, the foam will turn into weak metal walls (and floors, if there isn't one on the tile), which can be destroyed with a few whacks of a blunt object.
            A silly chem that can be as helpful or as harmful as you want it to be, you can either plug up holes in the station or inconvenience people with huge metal obstructions. Unlike other foams, this one can't be slipped on (since it doesn't use water).
