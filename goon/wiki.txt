    tags: [medical, tox, heal, depletion]
    info:
      note: Good baseline thing for detoxifying someone, but won't always keep up with the hellpoisons.
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: Increases the depletion rate of all other chems by 0.5, heals 1.5 TOX damage.

  - name: Saline-Glucose Solution
    ingredients:
      - Salt
      - Water
      - Sugar
    tags: [medical, brute, burn, heal]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: 33% chance per cycle of healing 1 point each of BRUTE and BURN damage.
      notes: The Shock ailment checks to see if you have any saline in you. If you do, there is a fixed chance per cycle that it'll reduce or remove the disease. This means that there's no specific amount needed to cure, but the longer it's in you, the more chances it'll have to cure the ailment.  
      
  - name: Styptic Powder
    ingredients: 
      - Aluminium 
      - Hydrogen 
      - Oxygen 
      - Sulphuric Acid

    info:
      reaction_message: The solution yields an astringent powder.
      per_cycle: 55% chance per cycle of healing 2 points of BRUTE damage.
      depletion_rate: 2
      application_effect: |
                          -TOUCH: Heal 1 point of brute per unit applied. Splash, dropper.
                          -INGEST: Do 0.5 points of tox damage per unit ingested. Don't eat it, don't inject it.
      notes: It depletes rapidly in the blood, so most of your healing will come upfront from a topical application. 

  - name: Silver Sulfadiazine
    ingredients: 
      - Silver
      - Sulfur
      - Oxygen
      - Chlorine

  - name: Synthflesh
    ingredients: 
      - Blood
      - Carbon
      - Styptic Powder
    tags: [medical, brute, burn, heal]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: Does nothing in the bloodstream currently.
      application_effect: |
                          -TOUCH: Heals 1.5 BRUTE and 1.5 BURN per unit applied.
      notes: Splashing a beaker of synthflesh on someone is very, very effective. The medics will love chemistry a whole lot if you provide them with synthflesh patches or beakers.
      
  - name: Omnizine
    sources: 
      - Extracted from white cannabis leaves.
      - Propuffs
      - Donk Pockets
    tags: [medical, brute, burn, oxy, tox, heal, addictive]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.3
      overdose_threshold: 100
      per_cycle: 65% chance to heal one each of OXY, TOX, BRUTE and BURN.
      notes: Slightly addictive. Medbay will love the botanists if they manage to provide it. Might buff the healing rates and lower the depletion soon. 

  - name: Calomel
    ingredients: 
      - Mercury 
      - Chlorine
      - !step Heat to 320
    heat_to: 320
    tags: [medical, depletion, tox, damage]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 2
      per_cycle: Increases all depletion rates by 5. +5 TOX damage while health > 20.
      notes: Aggressive purgative. It'll do a lot of tox damage itself but it cannot kill you, as the tox damage only applies while you are above 20 health. Use for emergencies to handle the really aggressive poisons that would definitely kill you if they remain active for long.
      
  - name: Potassium Iodide
    ingredients: 
      - Potassium
      - Iodine
    sources:
      - Extracted from unmutated nureous leaves.
    tags: [medical, rad, heal]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: 80% chance of removing 1 RAD. Radiation is cumulative and causes tox+burn.
      notes: Simple, kinda weak, but can help counter radiation events and radium somewhat. 
      
  - name: Pentetic Acid
    ingredients: 
      - Welding Fuel 
      - Chlorine
      - Ammonia 
      - Embalming Fluid 
      - Sodium 
      - Cyanide
    tags: [medical, rad, tox, depletion, heal, brute, damage]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: Reduces 7 RAD, heals 3 TOX damage, increases all depletion rates by 4; 33% chance of taking 1 unit brute damage
      notes: Complicated recipe, apex antitox/antiradiation treatment. 
      
  - name: Cryoxadone
    ingredients: 
      - Cryostylane
      - Plasma 
      - Acetone 
      - Unstable Mutagen
    tags: [medical, oxy, tox, brute, burn, heal]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: IF BODY TEMP IS BELOW 240, heals 10 OXY, 3 TOX, 3 BRUTE, 3 BURN
      notes: Requires cooling the person before it kicks in, but heals incredibly well. 
      
  - name: Epinephrine
    ingredients: 
      - Phenol
      - Hydrogen 
      - Oxygen
      - Chlorine
      - Acetone
      - Diethylamine
    tags: [medical, stun, oxy, losebreath, tox, brute, burn, heal, heart, overdose, ko, stun, crit]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.2
      overdose_threshold: 20
      per_cycle: Reduces most of the knockout/stun effects. Attempts to cap OXY damage at 35 and LOSEBREATH at 3. If health is between -10 to -65, heals 1 TOX, 1 BRUTE, 1 BURN. Rolls a chance to fix heart problems.
      notes: Can make you pretty sick in overdoses. Rapidly counters histamine / allergy reactions. Very useful for stabilizing someone who is in mid-crit damage, standard emergency shot to buy yourself some time. If things are really bad, go for atropine instead. Ephedrine is similar to epinephrine but is a bit weaker. 
      
  - name: Atropine
    ingredients: 
      - Ethanol
      - Acetone 
      - Diethylamine
      - Phenol
      - Sulphuric Acid
    sources:
      - Extracted from black venne fibers.
    tags: [medical, tox, damage, brute, burn, heal, heart, oxy, losebreath, depletion, crit]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.2
      overdose_threshold: 25
      per_cycle: | 
                 1 TOX damage if used over -60 health. Causes dizziness and confusion.
                 If under -25 health, heals 3 BRUTE + 3 BURN. Rolls a chance to fix heart problems. Attempts to cap OXY damage at 65 and LOSEBREATH at 5. Increases sarin depletion by 10.
      notes: Fairly similar to epinephrine but will rapidly push deep-crit damage levels towards shallow crit levels. Use this if you find someone who is right at the edge of death. Flushes sarin extremely rapidly. Atropine alone won't outright kill people but it's a pretty decent debilitating poison if you wanna use it that way. 
      
  - name: Salicylic Acid
    ingredients: 
      - Sodium 
      - Phenol 
      - Carbon 
      - Oxygen 
      - Sulphuric Acid
    sources:
      - Extracted from unmutated contusine leaves.
    tags: [medical, brute, overdose, temperature, speed]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.1
      overdose_threshold: 25
      per_cycle: |
                 If BRUTE damage is under 50, 50% chance to heal one unit.
                 Tries to return high body temps towards normal. Fairly well counters walkspeed loss from being hurt.
      notes: Got beat up a bit and don't want to crawl the whole way to medbay? Pop one of these. Won't help severe damage. Slow depletion rate will keep it in your blood for awhile. 
      
  - name: Morphine
    soruces: 
      - Botany and QM can both provide it.
    tags: [medical, speed, addictive, overdose, ko, jitter]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      overdose_threshold: 20
      per_cycle: Dramatically counters movement reduction from severe injury. Reduces jitteriness if someone is shaking like crazy from whatever. Will knock you out within 36 cycles if any remains in you.
      notes: Used to be Sleep Toxin. Low doses are useful for the painkiller, otherwise it's mostly a grief chem. Getting people addicted to morphine is kinda funny. Could probably use some more benefits.
      
  - name: Salbutamol
    ingredients: 
      - Salicylic Acid
      - Lithium
      - Aluminium
      - Bromine
      - Ammonia
    tags: [medical, oxy, losebreath, heal]
    sources:
      - Extracted from unmutated contusine leaves.
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: Heals 6 OXY damage, reduces LOSEBREATH by 4 (which some things apply)
      notes: Speeds up recovery from suffocation damage, but more importantly, it'll help counter suffocating/losebreath poisons and the suffocation that ramps up in critical health. Really underused emergency med, makes dealing with critical-health people a lot easier.
      
  - name: Perfluorodecalin
    ingredients: 
      - Hydrogen
      - Fluorine 
      - Oil 
      - !step Heat to 320
    heat_to: 320
    tags: [medical, oxy, losebreath, brute, burn, heal, addictive]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: Heals 25 OXY damage, causes LOSEBREATH - so you can't talk, but it prevents any suffocation damage from racking up despite that. 33% chance of healing 1 BRUTE and 1 BURN.
      notes: Fantastic for crime because it silences people. Also fantastic for pretty much negating all the accumulative damage from being in critical, will give you a really wide window of time to deal with other health problems. In theory you could stay in flatline for quite awhile with this stuff handling tissue oxygenation, but you might need Mannitol too. Can make spacewalking without internals possible. Somewhat addictive. 
      
  - name: Mannitol
    ingredients: 
      - Sugar
      - Hydrogen 
      - Water
    sources:
      - Extracted from dawning venne fibers.
    tags: [medical, brain, heal]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: Heals 3 BRAIN damage.
      notes: Use for concussions, changeling stings, bible beatings, flatline brain damage, bath salts, whatever.
      
  - name: Mutadone
    ingredients: 
      - Unstable Mutagen
      - Acetone
      - Bromine
    sources:
      - Extracted from dawning venne fibers.
    tags: [medical, mutation, heal]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: Removes all genetic bioeffects.
      notes: Did someone turn you into a gibbering chavish deaf dwarven lunatic? Take this. Might retool this a bit so it has a chance of removing an effect per cycle rather than scrubbing all of them instantly. 
      
  - name: Spaceacillin
    ingredients: 
      - Space Fungus 
      - Ethanol
    tags: [medical, disease, heal]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: Rolls a chance to cure some specific diseases. More uses planned for the future.
      notes: You probably won't use this much unless a random disease event hits. Medbay Phase 2 update will introduce some stuff like infections and sepsis.
      
  - name: Diphenhydramine
    ingredients: 
      - Oil
      - Carbon
      - Bromine 
      - Diethylamine
      - Ethanol
    tags: [medical, depletion, jitter, drowsiness]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: Causes a little bit of drowsiness, reduces jitteriness. Raises histamine and itching powder depletion rates by 3.
      notes: Mostly used as a precursor to a couple of the illegal drugs. Might be needed for bee stings, histamine poisonings, itching powder (not enough people use itching powder!!!). More planned for it.
      
  - name: Haloperidol
    ingredients: 
      - Chlorine
      - Fluorine
      - Aluminium

      per_cycle: |
                 Increases depletion rates for most stimulating/hallucinogenic drugs by 5. Reduces druggy effects and jitteriness. Causes drowsiness, 20% chance to cause 1 BRAIN damage.
                 Cures space madness and berserker.
      notes: Treat it like a general antipsychotic, treat/neutralize drugged up maniacs.
      
  - name: Antihol
    ingredients: 
      - Ethanol 
      - Charcoal
    tags: [medical, depletion, tox, heal, drunk]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4
      per_cycle: Raises ethanol depletion rates by 8. Can slowly heal a small bit of TOX damage.
      notes: Sober someone up in a hurry. Nefarious people sometimes spike other poisons with ethanol or booze reagents to sabotage charcoal treatments.

    tags: [medical, depletion]
    info:
      depletion_rate: 0.4

  - name: Teporone
    ingredients: 
      - Silicon 
      - Acetone 
      - Plasma

The more you use, the longer it takes before anything happens, but the harder it hits when it does. With large doses your target can consume something poisoned, walk around for a few minutes minding their own business, and then abruptly die with no real warning. Very devious to use.

             A couple of common chem recipes can produce this if poorly mixed, and production of cyanide will dose nearby people if they aren''t wearing gas masks. Also a fairly easy poison.

      notes: |
             Sparks, then blows the fuck up a second or two later. Damage scales up with reagent volume.
             Slow depletion means you can poison someone with it and then wait for then to encounter a heat source awhile later. KABOOM!

      notes: |
             Comes into existence at 0 degrees, but slowly heats other reagents up towards 1000.
             Can make non-flammable things scaldingly hot, but so can a welder or lighter. Fun for delayed self-heating reactions.
