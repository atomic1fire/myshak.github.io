  - name: APC (Break)
    info:
      notes: There are four wires. Two short out the APC when cut, one cuts AI control when cut, and one does nothing when cut, but unlocks the APC when pulsed with a multitool.  There's a chance you'll get shocked when cutting wires, so either have insulated gloves or do it in an isolated area where no-one will find you.  South maintenance is a good choice.
