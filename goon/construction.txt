              If you use more than 10 floor tiles, the finished floorbot will have however many you put in. If you use less than 10, the floorbot will have 10. Therefore, it is most efficient to use 1-2 in creation and load the rest after the floorbot is done.

    info: 
      notes: |
             Be advised since it is a 64x64 sprite you have to stand on the South West corner of the pod sprite in order to construct it.
             
             Tag it with a labeler to give it a unique name. To add extras, use a crowbar on the South West corner of the pod and add any system. To replace an existing system (like the engine), click the pod with an empty hand while the maintenance panel is open to bring up an interface for adding and removing installed systems. You can't replace a pod's armor once it is already built. You can also change the gas mix used for the engine and the gas mix used for the pod's life support system, though this doesn't have much of a use yet other then to suffocate the people in the pod with plasma.
