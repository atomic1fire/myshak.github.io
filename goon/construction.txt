To replace an existing system (like the engine), click the pod with an empty hand while the maintenance panel is open to bring up an interface for adding and removing installed systems. You can't replace a pod's armor once it is already built. You can also change the gas mix used for the engine and the gas mix used for the pod's life support system, though this doesn't have much of a use yet other then to suffocate the people in the pod with plasma.

  - name: Entire rooms (ABC-U)
    info:
      notes: ABC-Us and blueprint markers can be found in the supply warehouse. You don't need to replicate entire rooms. You can pick a section of it or multiple sections to create different rooms. The blueprint marker can create multiple blueprints before running out of energy. This way you can pick all the pieces you want in advance and put them together in a new configuration. Remember to save them with their own names so you don't get them mixed.

  - name: APC (hack)
    info:
      notes: There are four wires. Two short out the APC when cut, one cuts AI control when cut, and one does nothing when cut, but unlocks the APC when pulsed with a multitool.  There's a chance you'll get shocked when cutting wires, so either have insulated gloves or do it in an isolated area where no-one will find you.  South maintenance is a good choice.
